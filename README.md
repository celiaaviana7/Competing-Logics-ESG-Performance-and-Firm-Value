# Competing Logics in the Nexus of ESG Performance and Firm’s Value: The Case of GCC and Other Emerging Economies  
Empirical study on ESG performance and firm valuation across GCC and other emerging economies.  

## About the Project  
This research explores the **contradictory relationship between ESG performance and firm value** in emerging economies.  
We investigate whether firms that perform better in **Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)** dimensions experience improved profitability but lower market valuation.  

Our study is motivated by the long-standing debate between:  
- **Shareholder Theory** (Friedman, 1970): firms exist to maximize profits for shareholders.  
- **Stakeholder Theory**: firms have moral obligations to people and the planet and also pursuing the triple bottom line (People, Planet, and Profit).  

Empirical results across prior studies have been **inconclusive** as some show ESG enhances financial performance, while others suggest it harms firm value. This project fills that gap by examining the **competing institutional logics** behind these mixed results.

## Objectives  
- To test the relationship between **ESG performance** and **firm financial performance (ROE)**.  
- To examine the impact of ESG on **firm value (Tobin’s Q)**.  
- To assess whether **financial performance mediates** the ESG–firm value nexus.  
- To compare **GCC+ countries** (Egypt, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Turkey) with other emerging economies.

## Data & Methodology  
- **Dataset:** 2,149 firm-year observations from 19 emerging countries (2015–2021)  
- **Sources:** Refinitiv ESG scores & World Bank Macroeconomic Data  
- **Variables:**  
  - ESG score (and sub-dimensions E, S, G)  
  - Firm Value → Tobin’s Q  
  - Financial Performance → ROE  
  - Controls: Growth, Size, Leverage, CAPEX, GDP, HDI, and COVID dummy  
- **Econometric Approach:** Three-step mediation model following [*Zhou et al. (2022)*](https://doi.org/10.1002/bse.3089).

---

## Key Findings  
- ESG performance **improves financial performance** (ROE).  
- However, ESG performance **reduces market valuation** (Tobin’s Q).  
- No mediation effect of financial performance between ESG and firm value.  
- GCC+ firms experience **stronger positive ESG–ROE links**, showing a growing investor shift toward sustainability.  

---

## Theoretical Contribution  
- Highlights **institutional logics theory** (Reay & Hinings, 2009):  
  Investors still prioritize profitability, even when ESG enhances real performance.  
- Explains the **substituting logic** between social responsibility and profit maximization.  

---

## Policy & Practical Implications  
- Encourages policymakers and firms in GCC+ and emerging markets to **integrate sustainability** without undermining investor confidence.  
- Suggests shifting investor logic to **value non-monetary benefits** such as environmental and social impact.
